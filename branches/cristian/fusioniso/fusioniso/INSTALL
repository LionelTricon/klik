If you obtained fusioniso from the svn repository you need the following
software:

- automake 1.10

In order to create the configure script and related files you can use the
following command:

$ autoreconf -i

After that, or if you obtained fusioniso from the official tarballs, the usual
autotools command apply:

$ ./configure && make && make install
