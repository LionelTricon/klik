Fusioniso is a fork of fuseiso dedicated for the klik2 project

Usage:

    fusioniso [-n] [-p] [-u] [-b|d|B <sandbox_path>] [-c <iocharset>] [-h] <isofs_image_file> <mount_point> [<FUSE library options>]

mounts image, while fusermount shipped with FUSE library can be used to unmount:

    fusermount -u <mountpoint>

fusioniso options are:

    -n                       -- do NOT maintain file $HOME/.mtab.fusioniso
    -p                       -- maintain mount point;
                                create it if it does not exists and delete it on exit
    -c <iocharset>           -- specify iocharset for Joliet filesystem
    -h                       -- print this screen
    -t                       -- debug mode
    -u                       -- union mounting feature for klik2 (forced if -b, -d or -B)
    -b <path>                -- sandbox feature for klik2 (redirect all modification from $HOME user to <path>)
    -d <path>                -- sandbox feature for klik2 (redirect all modification from $HOME user dot files and folders to <path>)
    -B <path>                -- sandbox feature for klik2 (redirect all modification to <path>) [Experimental]

Common FUSE library options are:

    -f     -- run in foreground, do not daemonize
    -d     -- run in foreground and print debug information
    -s     -- run single-threaded

fusioniso supports plain ISO images (created by mkisofs for example), BIN and NRG images 
containing ISO9660 filesystem. Along with standard ISO9660 filesystem it support some common extensions: 

Joliet              Common in windows world. Allow long filenames stored in unicode.
RockRidge           Common in unix world. Allow long filenames, deep directories, symbolic links and permission bits to be stored.
zisofs              Compressed filesystem, drastically increases capasity of standard CDROM.

In fact i found what CCD (CloneCD) .IMG files along with .MDF (Alcohol 120%) images 
can be mounted without problems because their format looks exactly as .BIN image file format. 
So currently fusioniso supports disk images with following extensions: 

.iso
.img
.bin
.mdf
.nrg

Although, BIN images support have now major limitation -- fusioniso does not handle .CUE files in any way 
and thus can work only with first track of the BIN image. I don`t know if this is important 
to support .CUE files properly. Please email me if you need it. Support for other types of media  
descriptors like .ccd and .mds looks more difficult task because no one know it`s format.
