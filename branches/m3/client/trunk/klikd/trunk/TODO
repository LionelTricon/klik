Make it compatible with freedesktop standards

Implement a GUI configuration tool. I'd implement it as a general klik configuration tool, inside klik program ("klik config"?)

Work on the autorun system so every user gets klikd running automatically. Try to make this as distro-independant as possible (freedesktop blah blah blah)

Make sure it builds on every system

Make klikd aware of configuration changes to motify its behaviour on the fly (maybe a inotify watch to the configuration files?)

Python prototype to check footprint impact
