This is the "Milestone 3" branch. Only bugfixes allowed here. New features or
major code changes have to go to trunk (as before).

This branch will be used for our FOSDEM presentations.

Remember to apply any bugfix to trunk as well (if appropriate), and backport
fixes which you put into trunk also to this branch (if appropriate).

If you fix an issue reported in our tracker, please add an extra line to your
commit log message like this:
FIX for #159
