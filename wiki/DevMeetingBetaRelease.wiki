#summary Dev meeting about a beta release
= Introduction =

We'd like to schedule a developer meeting  Saturday, April 27, 9pm CET (please contact killerkiwi if this time/day wont suit)

= Agenda =

The basic idea is to do a google... we are saying this works, use it, it 'might' break its only a beta.

What we need for klik2 beta:

  * Uninstaller - this is a must
  * Website
    * Focus on games (other apps still available, just market the games aspect)?
    * Are wine apps working right now? A set of packaged free windows games that work with a click would be great publicity. [ `lionel : not for the moment, still a work in progress` ]
    * Develop benchmarks of games/hdd intensive apps (people is very worried about cmg speed and space)
  * Complete Merge? or drop it
  * Feature freeze - We will not be adding any new features at this point if anything we will cut features to get a stable working release out of the door.
  * Drop reusable process (for now)
  * fix unpack/pack to be logical in file paths
  * create beta branch
  * package beta release

Please add important items you may have to the list
