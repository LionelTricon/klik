= Packages for installing the klik client =

klik packages for most commonly used desktop distributions can be found [http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/probono/ here]. Note that these packages are built from SVN, and contain binaries compiled from the recent development tree of klik. They are mainly intended for developers, and for users who wish to try out the latest versions of klik. If you are an end user, you should ask your distribution to include a stable version of the klik client instead.

== openSUSE Build Service ==

These packages have been compiled using the openSUSE Build Service, which allows us to easily build clean packages for a range of distributions.   The development packages are also hosted by the openSUSE Build Service and hence the download.opensuse.org lines below so do not worry if you are not using openSUSE, the lines below are right and the packages have been built for the different distributions.
